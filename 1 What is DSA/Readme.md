More About DSA

C++ is a powerful and high-performance programming language used for system/software development and game programming. Learning DSA in C++ instead of any other language have many advantages such as:

Memory Management: Learning DSA in C++ gives you a deep knowledge of lower-level memory management which improves your understanding of data structures.

Versatile: Knowledge of DSA in C++ is versatile and can be transferred to other languages, as many modern languages are built on similar syntax.

Competitive Programming: C++ is widely used in competitive programming due to its speed and rich set of libraries allowing you to take an edge is problem-solving.

Object Oriented: C++ allows you to implement data structures as classes, making your code closer to the real implementations of data structures.
